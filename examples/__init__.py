"""Examples of the module use, both as simple applications and as helper
classes for reuse in more complete applications.

Overview
--------

This is a collection of examples, utility classes and other scraps of code which
demonstrate the use of the library in common applications. Many of these
examples will require extension, or further development in real applications.
However they should give some idea of what those more complete applications may
look like.

Tested Implementations
----------------------

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:

  * Raspberry Pi Pico W
