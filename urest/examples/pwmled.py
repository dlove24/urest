"""An example of a 'noun' class, able to serve as the basis for PWM control of
an LED attached to a suitable GPIO pin.

Overview
--------

This is a reasonably minimal example of a 'noun' class, which inherits from
`urest.api.base.APIBase`. It also requires the `Pin` library from MicroPython:
but should be able to be adapted to other GPIO libraries which provide a similar
interface.

In contrast to the `urest.examples.simpleled.SimpleLED` class, the
`urest.examples.pwmled.PWMLED` class shows the use of the `ayncio`
`create_tasks()` hook within a `urest.api.base.APIBase` 'noun' to set off slow
running tasks. This allows the state update to be returned to the network client
via the API 'immediately' (at least subject to the other tasks outstanding and
network conditions); without waiting for the _actual_ internal state to
complete. This is a much more realistic scenario for use in the control of
external devices: especially devices such as motors which may take seconds (or
longer) to obtain the correct state.

API
---

The 'noun' will return two objects in the JSON state, in response to `get_state`
requests

  * `actual` : The _current_ state of the output, which will be `0` for fully off
and `1` for fully on
  * `desired`: The _next_ state, if any, that the output is
currently transitioning to; either `0` for fully off and `1` for fully on

This gives a full state table as follows

| Actual State | Desired State | Description                                                  |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 0             | Output fully `off`                                           |
| 0            | 1             | Output commanded `on`; currently turning from `off` to `on`  |
| 1            | 0             | Output commanded `off`; currently turning from `on` to `off` |
| 1            | 1             | Output fully `on`                                            |
