"""An example of a small application which control a single GPIO pin.

Overview
--------

This examples export a single noun, `led`, which is used to set, test and otherwise control a single GPIO pin. It can be used an example of a the way in which this API class can be used, along with the definition of the  `urest.examples.simpleled.SimpleLED` class.

To use this example, the variables `SSID` and `PASSWORD` must also be defined, and set to suitable values for the local network. Space for these variables has been provided at the start of the '`main`' loop. The code will then attempt to create an API server on the _network_ side of the machines local interfaces, bound to port 80.

.. Note:: MicroPython Includes

    This module as presented has a number of `try..finally` blocks which exist to
    catch uses of this code where the standard MicroPython libraries are not
    available. If _known_ to be running under MicroPython, or suitably adapted,
    these can be removed.

.. Warning:: Exposed Network Ports

    This code _does not_ attempt to take any defensive stances with respect
    to the network environment, beyond the normal measures in the API code.
    As is normal for MicroPython implementations, it also assumes the SSID
    and the network password are embedded in the code, and therefore exposed.
    Careful review of the application code, and the network environment, should
    be undertaken before this code is used in anything other than a benign
    environment under _total_ control of the developer.

Tested Implementations
----------------------

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:

  * Raspberry Pi Pico W
