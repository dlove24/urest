"""
Utility function and exceptions which handle the network initialisation for the Pico W. The majority of this library is boiler-plate, and mimics the C library set-up required by the Pico W. For compatibility with that library (and the documentation) the `Exception` names in this module mirror those of the C library.

!!! warning "Pico W Only"

    This function will _only_ work on the Pico W, and with the Pico W
    network library. Loading this function on a Pico H, or without the Pico W
    network library, will result in an error.

def wireless_enable(
    ssid: str, password: str, link_light: int | str = "WL_GPIO0",
) -> None:
    """
    Enable the default wireless interface, connecting to the networking using
    the specified `ssid` and `password`. Optionally also supply the name, or the pin
    number, of the GPIO pin to use as the `link_light`, which will be 'on' if the
    network connection succeeds (and 'off' otherwise).

    !!! danger "Clear Text Password"

        As with the default wireless library, the `password` **must** be supplied to
        this function in clear text. This presents a potential exposure risk
        of the `password`, and that risk should be mitigated by appropriate storage and
        handling of the password _before_ calling this function.

    Parameters
    ----------

    ssid: str
        The SSID of the network to connect to.
    password: str
        The plain text of the password needed by the wireless network.
    link_light: int or str, optional
        The name (if a `str`) or number (if an `int`) of the GPIO pin to use as
        the link light. If a connection succeeds, this GPIO Pin will be set 'high':
        otherwise 'low' on failure. Defaults to the on-board (user) LED of the Pico W.

    Raises
    ------

    NameError
        The name (`int` or `str`) for the `link_light` is invalid, and a `Pin` with this name cannot be created.
    WirelessNetworkError
        The network named `ssid` cannot be joined with the specified `password`. See the exact `msg` of the `Exception` to determine whether this is a temporary (and may be retried) or a permanent error.
