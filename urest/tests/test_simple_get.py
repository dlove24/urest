    .. NOTE::

    This test may fail if the `DELETE` verb is handled incorrectly (not returning the noun to the initial state) **or** because the `GET` verb is handled incorrectly. Therefore the results of the `test_simple_delete` test runner should also be taken into consideration when interpreting failure.
