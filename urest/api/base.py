Implements the 'Abstract' Base Class for all the nouns used by the
`urest.http.server.RESTServer` class in defining resources.


.. Note::
  MicroPython does not implement the
  [`abc` module](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/abc.html) which provides
  language-level support for abstract base classes. Therefore the
  `urest.http.server.RESTServer` class checks the ancestors of the class
  passed as a resource for the API to ensure they derive from `urest.api.base.APIBase`.
  Any class which _does not_ have `urest.api.base.APIBase` as an ancestor will
  therefore **not** work as a valid resource.

  This also means that `urest.api.base.APIBase` is not a pure virtual ABC, and
  so implements a minimum set of methods which hold and manipulate resource state.
  However all methods such as `urest.api.base.APIBase.get_state` and
  `urest.api.base.APIBase.set_state` are expected to be overridden in working
  implementations.

        """The Abstract Base Class for the nouns, used in the response from the server.

        This base class defines the minimum interface used in marshalling requests from
        the clients by the `urest.http.server.RESTServer` class. The API defined by the
        server consists of 'nouns' representing the resources defined by the sub-classes
        of this base class, and the methods which act upon those resources (which map to
        the 'verbs' of the HTTP requests made to the `urest.http.server.RESTServer` class.

        Where data is returned to the client by the, e.g by the `get_state` method, JSON
        will ultimately be used as the encoding format. Sub-classes do not need to
        implement the saving of the object state to the client: however to assist they
        should be aware of the type of the each `value` returned as part of a `key/value`
        pair in the `Dictionary`.

        When returning data to the client, the `value` of each entry in the `Dictionary`
        will attempt to be inferred using the normal Python type library. If the type can be
        identified, then an appropriate JSON type will be used: otherwise the `value` of that
        `Dictionary` entry will be returned as a string.

        .. Warning:: Data will be returned to the client 'as is'
            No further checking on the validity (or otherwise) of the content of
            the `Dictionary` will be undertaken past this point. Anything that appear to be in
            a valid `Dictionary` will be returned to the client. It is the module consumers
            responsibility to ensure the returned data follows the form expected by those clients.
