"""Network interface and helper classes for abstracting the underlying HTTP
stream. This module provides the abstraction of the underlying socket handling
code, using in marshaling requests from clients and building the response. All
the socket handling is built around the Python 3 `asyncio` library for the low-
level network interface, and for the use of co-routines to simplify request
handling.

In most cases, consumers of this module only need to provide an `asynio` event
loop: see "Creating the Network Server" in the Section _Using the Module_ below.
By default the module will also bind to the _network_ address of the host on the
standard port 80 used by HTTP requests. This can be changed in the instantiation
of the  [`RESTServer`][urest.http.server.RESTServer] class.

Implementation
--------------

During the instantiation of the [`RESTServer`][urest.http.server.RESTServer]
class, the resulting object creates a socket bound to the specified address and
port (or the host network address and port 80 by default). This binding is
undertaken as part of the `asyncio` instantiation.


Using the Module
----------------

### Creating the Network Server

All network clients are assumed to be handled by an instance of the [`RESTServer`]
[urest.http.server.RESTServer] class from the `urest.http.server` module. The
[`RESTServer`][urest.http.server.RESTServer] class provides both an event loop for
the `asyncio` library, and also takes care of the lower-level networking interface
for the clients. Unless working with multiple instances (e.g. via a thread
library), most model consumers are assumed have a single instance of the
[`RESTServer`][urest.http.server.RESTServer] -- **but the module will not check
this**.

In most cases, something similar to the following will suffice

```python
  # Import the Asynchronous IO Library
  try:
    import uasyncio as asyncio
  except ImportError:
    import asyncio

  from urest.http import RESTServer

  app = RESTServer()

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.create_task(app.start())
    loop.run_forever()
```

!!! Warning
    There is no guarantee of thread-safety in this module, and all
    'concurrency' is assumed to be via co-routines provided by the `asyncio`
    library. For an overview of how multiple clients can be handled using
    co-routines, [Async IO in Python](https://realpython.com/async-io-python) is
    highly recommended reading.

### Creating the API Responses

Most module consumers will not use the [`urest.http.response`][urest.http.response]
module directly: but will instead sub-class [`APIBase`][urest.api.base.APIBase] to
provide the core of the response to the network clients. For details of how the
[`RESTServer`][urest.http.server.RESTServer] and [`APIBase`]
[urest.api.base.APIBase] classes interact, the module documentation for
`urest.api` should be consulted. In addition, the documentation for the
[`SimpleLED`][urest.examples.simpleled.SimpleLED] might prove useful as an example
of a simple implementation of the API.


Tested Implementations
----------------------

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:

  * Raspberry Pi Pico W
